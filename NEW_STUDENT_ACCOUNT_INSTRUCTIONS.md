# New Approved Student Account

I have successfully created a new student account that is already approved by the admin. Here's how to use it:

## Quick Access via Demo Login

1. **Go to the login page** of your LPHS SMS system
2. **Click on the "Demo Login" dropdown** in the top-right corner
3. **Select "Login as New Student (Approved)"** from the dropdown menu

This will automatically:
- Create the user account if it doesn't exist
- Create the student record with approved status
- Log you in immediately

## Account Details

- **Email:** `new.student@lphs.edu`
- **Password:** `DemoPass123!`
- **Student Name:** John Doe
- **Grade Level:** 8
- **Enrollment Status:** Approved (ready for section assignment)
- **School Year:** 2024-2025

## Student Information

- **Date of Birth:** May 15, 2009
- **Gender:** Male
- **Address:** 123 Main Street, City
- **Contact Number:** 09123456789
- **Emergency Contact:** Jane Doe (Mother) - 09987654321

## What This Account Can Do

Since this student account is **approved by admin**, it can:
- ✅ Login successfully to the student dashboard
- ✅ Access all student features
- ✅ Be assigned to sections by admin
- ✅ View grades, schedules, and announcements
- ✅ Access all student portal features

## Alternative Login Method

If you prefer to login manually:
1. Go to the regular login page
2. Enter email: `new.student@lphs.edu`
3. Enter password: `DemoPass123!`
4. Click Login

## Admin Actions Available

As an admin, you can also:
- Assign this student to a specific section
- Enroll the student (change status from "approved" to "enrolled")
- View the student in the admin dashboard under "Enrollments"

## Difference from Demo Student

- **Demo Student:** Basic demo account for testing
- **New Student:** Fully configured approved account ready for real use

The new student account represents a realistic scenario where a student has been approved by the admin and is ready to be assigned to classes.
